This application was created to identify local grow zones, scientific names, physical appearance and various other relevant information.

Created with dynamic HTML and CSS, highly responsive hover elements contain the information, making for a easier UI experience, possibly assisting in the visually impaired.

The Javascript pulls from various API's to identify and distinguish what particular plant is being display, storing search requests in localStorage.
